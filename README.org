* mybigword
Vocabulary builder using Zipf to extract English big words.

Zipf frequency of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it
appears per billion words. It's proposed by Marc Brysbaert.

Thanks to https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq for providing the data.

The program provides many tools to help you master big words,
- Extract big words using Zipf
- Automatically look up and output word definition
- Parse the subtitle (*.srt) and replay the movie when the word is spoken
- Pronounce the word at point
- Supports Window/Linux/macOS. [[http://www.mplayerhq.hu/][Mplayer]] is required for playing video.

* Install
Place =mybigword.el= and =eng.zipf= under [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Search.html][Load Path]]. Then add =(require 'mybigword)= to your configuration.
* Usage
Run =mybigword-show-big-words-from-file= or =mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer=. The words whose Zipf frequency less than =mybigword-upper-limit= are extracted as big words.

The above commands can be customized to look up word definition. See the tip [[Format output]].

* Tips
** Exclude words
Customize =mybigword-excluded-words= or =mybigword-personal-excluded-words= to exclude words.
** Format output
Customize =mybigword-default-format-function= to format the word for display.

For example, if it's =mybigword-format-with-dictionary=, the =dictionary-definition= is used to find the definitions of all big words.

Sample to display the dictionary definitions of big words:
#+begin_src elisp
(let* ((mybigword-default-format-function 'mybigword-format-with-dictionary))
  (mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer))
#+end_src

You can also set =mybigword-default-format-header-function= to add a header before displaying words.
** Parse the *.srt to play the video containing the word in org file
Make sure the org tree node has the property =SRT_PATH=.

Sample of org file:
#+begin_example
** Pronounce word at point
Use =mybigword-pronounce-word= to pronounce the word at point.

The word's audio is downloaded from [[https://dictionary.cambridge.org]].

The audio download url could be customized in =mybigword-default-audio-url-function=.
* Star Trek s06e26
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SRT_PATH: ~/Star.Trek.DS9-s06e26.Tears.of.the.Prophets.srt
  :END:
telepathic egotist
#+end_example

Move focus over the word like "egotist", and run =M-x mybigword-play-video-of-word-at-point=, =mplayer= plays the corresponding video at the time the word is spoken.

Mplayer's path can be customized through =mybigword-mplayer-program=.

Please note =mybigword-play-video-of-word-at-point= can be used in other major modes. See =mybigword-default-video-info-function= for details.
** Hide words
Customize =mybigword-hide-word-function= to hide word for display.
