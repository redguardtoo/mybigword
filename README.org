Vocabulary builder using Zipf to extract English big words.

Zipf frequency of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it
appears per billion words. It's proposed by Marc Brysbaert.

Thanks to https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq for providing the data.

The program provides many tools to help you master big words,
- Extract big words using Zipf
- Automatically look up and output word definition
- Parse the subtitle (*.srt) and replay the movie when the word is spoken
- Pronounce the word at point
- Supports Window/Linux/macOS. [[http://www.mplayerhq.hu/][Mplayer]] is required for playing video.

* Install
Place =mybigword.el= and =eng.zipf= under [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Search.html][Load Path]]. Then add =(require 'mybigword)= to your configuration.
* Usage
Run =mybigword-show-big-words-from-file= or =mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer=. The words whose Zipf frequency less than =mybigword-upper-limit= are extracted as big words.

The above commands can be customized to look up word definition. See the tip [[Format output]].

Here is the big words extracted from the script of [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708665/?ref_=ttep_ep12][Star Trek: Deep Space Nine  S06E12 "Who Mourns for Morn?"]]:

* Tips
** Exclude words
Customize =mybigword-excluded-words= or =mybigword-personal-excluded-words= to exclude words.
** Format output
Customize =mybigword-default-format-function= to format the word for display.

For example, if it's =mybigword-format-with-dictionary=, the =dictionary-definition= is used to find the definitions of all big words.

Sample to display the dictionary definitions of big words:
#+begin_src elisp
(let* ((mybigword-default-format-function 'mybigword-format-with-dictionary))
  (mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer))
#+end_src

You can also set =mybigword-default-format-header-function= to add a header before displaying words.
** Parse the *.srt to play the video containing the word in org file
Make sure the org tree node has the property =SRT_PATH=.

Sample of org file:
#+begin_example
** Pronounce word at point
Use =mybigword-pronounce-word= to pronounce the word at point.

The word's audio is downloaded from [[https://dictionary.cambridge.org]].

The audio download url could be customized in =mybigword-default-audio-url-function=.
* Star Trek s06e26
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SRT_PATH: ~/Star.Trek.DS9-s06e26.Tears.of.the.Prophets.srt
  :END:
telepathic egotist
#+end_example

Move focus over the word like "egotist", and run =M-x mybigword-play-video-of-word-at-point=, =mplayer= plays the corresponding video at the time the word is spoken.

If video is missing, the mp3 with similar name is played. See =mybigword-video2mp3= on how to generate mp3 from video files.

The video should be in the same directory of subtitle and its file name should be similar to the subtitle's file name.

The word is either the word at point, or selected string or string from input.

Mplayer's path can be customized through =mybigword-mplayer-program=.

Please note =mybigword-play-video-of-word-at-point= can be used in other major modes. See =mybigword-default-media-info-function= for details.
** Hide words
Customize =mybigword-hide-word-function= to hide word for display.
** Show image of the word
Use =mybigword-show-image-of-word= to show images of the word at point in external browser.

Please note =browse-url-generic= is used in this command.
